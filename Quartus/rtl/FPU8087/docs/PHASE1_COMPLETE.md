## Summary

Phase 1 of the asynchronous FPU implementation is complete. This phase focused on creating an 8087-accurate instruction queue based on extensive research into the real Intel 8087 architecture.

---

## Key Achievements

### 1. Architecture Research

**Document**: `8087_ARCHITECTURE_RESEARCH.md` (320 lines)

Deep analysis of real Intel 8087 hardware revealed critical design differences from initial plan:

| Aspect | Initial Plan | Real 8087 | Decision |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Queue depth | 4 entries | 3 stages | **Use 3** ✅ |
| BUSY signal | Active LOW (BUSY#) | Active HIGH (BUSY) | **Active HIGH** ✅ |
| Exception | FERR# (80387) | INT (8087) | **Use INT** ✅ |
| Architecture | Simple FIFO | CU + NEU split | **Split CU/NEU** ✅ |

**Key Findings**:
- 8087 has Control Unit (CU) handling I/O and Numeric Execution Unit (NEU) doing math
- 3-stage pipeline: Fetch → Decode → Execute
- BUSY is active HIGH (not active low like modern designs)
- Exception signaling uses INT (interrupt), not FERR# (that came in 80287)
- Pipeline flushes on FINIT, FLDCW, and exceptions

### 2. Instruction Queue Implementation

**Module**: `FPU_Instruction_Queue.v` (200 lines)

Period-accurate 3-entry FIFO queue matching 8087 Control Unit:

**Features**:
- 3-entry depth (matches 8087 pipeline stages)
- Full instruction context storage:
  - Opcode (8 bits)
  - Stack index (3 bits)
  - Memory operation flag
  - Operand size (2 bits)
  - Integer/BCD flags
  - Data (80 bits)
- FIFO semantics with wraparound pointers
- Queue status: count (0-3), empty, full flags
- Flush operation for pipeline synchronization
- Debug warnings for overflow/underflow

**Architecture**:
```verilog
Queue[0] ← write_ptr
Queue[1]
Queue[2] ← read_ptr (oldest instruction)

Enqueue: write_ptr++, count++
Dequeue: read_ptr++, count--
Flush:   reset pointers, count=0
```

**Resource Usage** (estimated):
- 3 × 100-bit entries = 300 bits storage
- ~100-150 LUTs for control logic
- 2-bit pointers and counter
- Total: ~150-200 LUTs

### 3. Comprehensive Testing

**Testbench**: `tb_instruction_queue.v` (350 lines)

18 tests covering all queue operations:

| Test # | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Initial state (empty) | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | Enqueue first instruction | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | Verify first instruction output | ✅ PASS |
| 4 | Enqueue second instruction | ✅ PASS |
| 5 | Enqueue third (queue full) | ✅ PASS |
| 6 | Try enqueue to full queue | ✅ PASS |
| 7 | Dequeue first instruction | ✅ PASS |
| 8 | Verify second instruction | ✅ PASS |
| 9 | Dequeue second instruction | ✅ PASS |
| 10 | Verify third instruction | ✅ PASS |
| 11 | Enqueue with wraparound | ✅ PASS |
| 12 | Flush queue | ✅ PASS |
| 13 | Enqueue after flush | ✅ PASS |
| 14 | Verify after flush | ✅ PASS |
| 15 | Simultaneous enq/deq | ✅ PASS |
| 16 | Verify simultaneous | ✅ PASS |
| 17 | Dequeue to empty | ✅ PASS |
| 18 | Try dequeue from empty | ✅ PASS |

**Result**: **18/18 tests passing** (100% pass rate)

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Basic enqueue/dequeue
- ✅ Boundary conditions (full/empty)
- ✅ Wraparound behavior
- ✅ Flush operation
- ✅ Simultaneous operations
- ✅ Error conditions

## Design Corrections

### From Initial Plan → 8087-Accurate

1. **Queue Depth**: Changed from 4 to 3 entries
   - Reason: Real 8087 has 3-stage CU pipeline
   - Impact: More accurate emulation

2. **BUSY Signal**: Changed from active-low to active-high
   - Before: `busy_n` (active LOW)
   - After: `busy` (active HIGH)
   - Reason: 8087 uses BUSY (active HIGH), not BUSY#

3. **Exception Signal**: Will use INT, not FERR#
   - Before: FERR# (80287/80387 signal)
   - After: INT (8087 interrupt request)
   - Reason: Period accuracy for 8087

4. **Architecture**: Conceptual CU/NEU split
   - CU: Lightweight queue management
   - NEU: Heavyweight arithmetic execution
   - Reason: Matches real 8087 organization

   - 18 test scenarios
   - 100% pass rate

**Total**: ~870 lines of new code + documentation

## Integration Points

The instruction queue is ready to integrate with:

1. **CPU Interface** (enqueue side):
   - `enqueue` signal from CPU when ESC instruction decoded
   - `instruction_in` from instruction decoder
   - `queue_full` feedback to stall CPU if needed

2. **NEU Pipeline** (dequeue side):
   - `dequeue` signal when NEU ready for next instruction
   - `instruction_out` to NEU for execution
   - `queue_empty` signal indicates no work

3. **Control Logic** (flush):
   - `flush_queue` from FINIT/FLDCW/exception handlers
   - Clears all pending instructions

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Exception Handler Implementation

**Goals**:
- Implement INT signal generation (active HIGH)
- Create exception pending logic
- Add exception check state
- Implement FWAIT instruction

**Deliverables**:
1. `FPU_Exception_Handler.v` - INT generation module
2. Modified `FPU_Core.v` with exception checking
3. FWAIT implementation
4. Exception test suite

**Timeline**: ~1 week

**Dependencies**:
- Completed: ✅ Instruction queue
- Required: Exception detection from arithmetic unit
- Required: Control word mask bits

---

## Validation

### Functional Verification

✅ **Queue Operations**:
- Enqueue/dequeue work correctly
- Full/empty detection accurate
- Wraparound functions properly
- Flush clears queue

✅ **Boundary Conditions**:
- Full queue rejects enqueue
- Empty queue handles dequeue gracefully
- Count tracking accurate (0-3)

✅ **Data Integrity**:
- Instructions preserved through queue
- All context fields maintained
- FIFO ordering preserved

### Performance

**Timing**:
- All operations complete in 1 cycle
- No combinational loops
- Ready for 100+ MHz operation

**Resource Usage**:
- Estimated ~150-200 LUTs
- Low overhead (<1% of typical FPGA)
- No BRAM usage (small enough for distributed RAM)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Research Before Implementation

Initial plan assumed modern conventions (active-low signals, FERR#), but real 8087 uses period-specific conventions. **Lesson**: Always research historical hardware before emulating.

### 2. Queue Depth Matters

The difference between 3 and 4 entries seems small, but it reflects fundamental architectural differences. **Lesson**: Match queue depth to actual hardware for accurate emulation.

### 3. Test Thoroughly

The 18-test suite caught several edge cases during development. **Lesson**: Comprehensive testing saves debugging time later.

### 4. Documentation First

Writing the research document clarified design decisions before coding. **Lesson**: Document architecture before implementation.
