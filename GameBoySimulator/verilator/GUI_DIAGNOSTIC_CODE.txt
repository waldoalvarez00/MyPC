=== ADD THIS TO YOUR GUI CODE ===

Find your main rendering loop in the GUI code (wherever you call dut->eval() or tick the simulation).

Add this diagnostic code:

// Add at the top of your file with other variables:
static bool boot_completed = false;
static int frame_count = 0;

// Add inside your main loop (after dut->eval()):
frame_count++;

// Check boot ROM status
if (!boot_completed && dut->dbg_boot_rom_enabled == 0) {
    boot_completed = true;
    printf("✅ BOOT ROM DISABLED at frame %d\n", frame_count);
}

// Print status every second (60 frames)
if (frame_count % 60 == 0) {
    printf("[Frame %d] boot=%d addr=$%04X lcd_mode=%d lcd_data=%d\n",
           frame_count,
           dut->dbg_boot_rom_enabled,
           dut->dbg_cpu_addr,
           dut->dbg_lcd_mode,
           dut->dbg_lcd_data_gb);
}

=== WHAT TO LOOK FOR ===

After you add this and rebuild, run the GUI and check the OUTPUT window in Visual Studio.

You should see output like:
[Frame 60] boot=1 addr=$0007 lcd_mode=0 lcd_data=3
✅ BOOT ROM DISABLED at frame 65
[Frame 120] boot=0 addr=$0150 lcd_mode=2 lcd_data=3

If you see:
✅ Boot ROM disables -> Fix worked, but VRAM issue remains
❌ Boot ROM stays enabled -> Fix didn't apply, need to re-verilate

Tell me what you see in the OUTPUT window!
