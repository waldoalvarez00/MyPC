=== VHDL GBse (T80) vs Verilog GBse (TV80) Comparison ===

VHDL GBse.vhd (lines 206-226):
- RD_n set to '1' (inactive) at start of each CLKEN
- RD_n set to '0' (active) during TState "001" or "010" when NoRead='0' and Write='0'

Verilog tv80_gameboy.v (lines 98-126):
- RD_n set to 1'b1 (inactive) at start of each CLKEN  
- RD_n set to 1'b0 (active) during tstate[1] or tstate[2] when no_read==0 and write==0

Key difference found: The logic looks equivalent, but timing may differ.
The real issue is the TV80 core's internal state machine behavior after JP.
